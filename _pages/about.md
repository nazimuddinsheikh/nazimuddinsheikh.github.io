I am (Full) Professor at the Department of Computing, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. I am Chief Exacutive and Chief Scientist of the Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub. I am also Group Leader of the Information Security and Privacy Research Group at CSIRO Data61, Australia since December 2015.

December 2015 – present: Group Leader of the Information Security and Privacy Research Group at CSIRO Data61, Australia.

February 2014-December 2015 : Research Leader at the Mobile Systems Research Group (MSRG) NICTA, Australia.

Feb. 2012-present : Principal Researcher at the Network Research Group NICTA, Australia.
May 2013-present : Visiting Professor at ICT-China Academy of Science (CAS), Beijing China.
2008-2013: Research Scientist at PLANETE (Privatics) team, INRIA Rhone-Alpes, France.

<title>Research<\title>

I am spearheading Data61’s R&D activities in privacy-preserving technologies with a focus on private date sharing, Information security and Web and mobile security. Before that, at INRIA, he co-invented the technology behind geolocalisation of malicious botnet motherhood servers and pioneered research in the security of internet coordinate systems. I have published over 200 peer-reviewed papers repeatedly in top journals and conferences, receiving many prestigious awards.

Our main research goals are:
Build data and information sharing platforms enabling privacy-preserving data sharing and trustworthy cyber defence collaboration.
Design and construct resilient and reliable software systems to enable defence mechanisms in distributed and potentially hostile environments.

Design and build usable and human-centric security technologies to change humans from the weakest link of the chain into a first line of active defence.

Quantify and understand threats and cyber risks including socio-economics and financial risks.

Design policies, governance and decision-making platforms to investigate regulation-compliance and facilitate cyber security mechanisms embedding within organisations.
